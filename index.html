        <p>Nowadays, there is a notion that 2D graphics are old-fashioned, and that has no place in the gaming industry since 3D is better in every way. However, every day we see examples where 2D still has its place in the industry, and not everyone has the funds to buy expensive consoles or PCs.</p>

        <p>Many 2D games are still realesed, and have a cult following because they are usually cheaper than 3D games and was proven over time thay age better. You can still enjoy the likes of Mario and Sonic games released a decade ago, but you will have a hard time enjoying early 3D graphics, they look clunky and out of place.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>However, there is a consensus between both game types, they both are projected to make people
             have hours of fun, there is no complaints that 3d models offer better graphics quality 
             actually, although this does not mean that 2d games don't have their gems too, it's 
             possible to see there are many titles that have been there for years and still receive a
              big love from their community players.</p>
